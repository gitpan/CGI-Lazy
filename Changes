	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X CGI::Lazy
	then added teh real code... here goes...

0.02	Sat Aug 2
	-reformatted POD so it will display on cpan
	-pulled ModPerl.pm from distribution so tests pass.  ModPerl will be distributed separately

0.02-r2 -uploaded partial distro to CPAN  oops.

0.02-r3 -fixed pod formatting again.  no changes to code

0.03	-split Auth.pm and Authz.pm ito separate distros
	-lowered requirements in Makefile.PL  they were unnecessarily high

0.04	-moved $VERSION into Lazy.pm 'cos ModPerl and Auth versions were overwriting it
	-fixed bug in Boilerplate.pm where __WIDGETID__ tag wasn't being parsed.
	-cleaned up deprecated code in Ajax.pm and Dataset.pm for parsing widget-specific javascript.  No real change, but build mechanism and naming convention much clearer now.
	-added readonly mode to Dataset
	-set Template.pm to die_on_bad_params => 0  It won't care now if you output a parameter to a template that doesn't contain that tag- will just ignore it

0.05	-removed bad js call to pushRow in Boilerplate Dataset single template
	-added some more error trapping to Javascript
	-extended Recordset to allow for table.field if table is recordset's native table
	-fixed bug between Ajax, Dataset, and Javascript that prevented insert of records > 9
	-added client side javascript example for Composite, Dataset.
	-added full Composite example to Composite.pm
	-improved documentation of Ajax.pm
	-extended ajaxSearch method of Ajax objects to allow for like queries.  can set like => 'liketype' to apply to web inputs or likevars => 'liketype' to do likes off of cgi vars
	-changed children and childarray methods of Composite to members and memberarray for accuracy sake, and to prevent confusion for parent/child relationships between member widgets
	-likewise changed Dataset property parentId to containerId
	-added 'type' to Composite, and added type parentChild which, when set up correctly, will handle select/insert/update on member widgets based on configureation.  delete will wait for further pondering.

0.06	-removed submit from boilerplate and dataset.  not flexible enough.  add it to the template as needed
	-changed non-external methods in Debug to return text, not print, and to print them to a div of id="debug"
	-added ability for dataset multiple to have no headers
	-added headings method to dataset to return tmpl vars with header strings
	-added header tmpl to boilerplate
	-fixed bug in Composite ParentChild for inserting records with autoincrement primary keys
	-added get mehtod to DB for returning only a single value
	-fixed bug in Dataset where singles couldn't insert.
	-fixed bug in Dataset where headings method didn't have any data till after a select.
	-fixed bug in Composite ParentChild where a search on the parent that returned no data put things into an endless loop
